# Contributing to alien
Alien is a project with a very small scope. Code size and project direction is important to the alien developers, and thus we
appreciate your cooperation with our goals.

# Step 1 (skip for bugfixes):
Open a Discussion pull request. The pull request should outline your idea / intention for the new
feature. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Use Case
* Impact on existing project (code size, performance, usability, etc)

One of the project maintainers should give the enhancement a yay / nay, at which point it can be worked on. The feature will
also be added to this repository's Github Project.

# Step 2: Implementation
If you're implementing a discussed idea, or somebody elses, the only requirement is to keep it reasonably well within the 
existing conventions. This includes:

* K&R styles (same-line-with-spaces) braces
* immutable where possible
* 100% test coverage
* 100% documentation coverage with all possible JSDoc attributes
* Small as readably possible
* 125 characters / line max

# Step 3: Pull Request
When you're ready to submit your pull request, make sure to reference **and close** the associated discussion issue associated
with the item
